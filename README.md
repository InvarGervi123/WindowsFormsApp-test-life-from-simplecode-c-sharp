# WindowsFormsApp - Test Life (from Simple Code in C#)

This is a small experimental Windows Forms application written in C# using Visual Studio. It serves as a simple test for GUI logic and life simulation elements, possibly inspired by Conway's Game of Life or similar systems.

## 🧠 Purpose

To test and demonstrate the logic of a simple simulation with GUI elements in a WinForms environment, likely created for learning and experimenting with event-driven programming in C#.

## 🔧 Features

* Basic graphical interface using Windows Forms
* Life simulation mechanics (details can be seen in the source code)
* Simple interaction and updates through form events

## 📁 Project Structure

* `Form1.cs` – Main form that handles user interaction and simulation logic.
* `Program.cs` – Standard WinForms entry point.
* `.csproj` and `.sln` – Project and solution files for Visual Studio.

## 🛠️ Requirements

* Visual Studio (2019 or later recommended)
* .NET Framework (4.7 or compatible)

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/InvarGervi123/WindowsFormsApp-test-life-from-simplecode-c-sharp.git
   ```
2. Open the solution file (`.sln`) in Visual Studio.
3. Build and run the project.
